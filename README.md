# STUDENT-ACADEMY
Student Academy is a full package of all  student requirements 

Generally students go through a lot of activities in their academic career.  
We came up with an idea to compound some of such activities under one website named Student Academy.


Student Academy is a compact website where mostly all academic needs of a student can be fulfilled such as applying for campus placements, browsing books in library, knowing about the latest workshops and conferences, uploading weeks schedule as a To-do list, shopping books online and also browsing all student friendly websites.
It also provides all academic books PDF’s.
